# Slack Integration Setup

## Overview

This project includes Slack integration for sending build notifications. When tests are run in GitHub Actions, notifications are sent to a Slack channel at the beginning and end of the test run.

## Requirements

To use the Slack integration, you need:

1. A Slack workspace
2. A Slack bot token with appropriate permissions
3. A Slack channel ID where notifications will be sent

## Setting Up for GitHub Actions

In GitHub Actions, the Slack token is stored as a secret named `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`. This is automatically used by the workflow.

### Adding the Secret to GitHub

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Click on "New repository secret"
5. Name: `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`
6. Value: Your Slack bot token (starts with `xoxb-`)
7. Click "Add secret"

## Setting Up for Local Testing

To test the Slack integration locally, you need to set the `SLACK_TOKEN` environment variable:

### Option 1: Set in .env file

Edit the `.env` file in the project root and uncomment/update the Slack settings:

```
### Slack Integration Settings ###
SLACK_TOKEN=your_slack_token_here
SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=C07FJG27D2L  # Or your custom channel ID
```

### Option 2: Set in terminal

#### Windows PowerShell
```powershell
$env:SLACK_TOKEN="your-slack-token"
```

#### Windows CMD
```cmd
set SLACK_TOKEN=your-slack-token
```

#### Linux/macOS
```bash
export SLACK_TOKEN=your-slack-token
```

## Testing the Slack Integration

To verify your Slack integration is working correctly, run:

```bash
npm run test-slack
```

Or check just the configuration without sending messages:

```bash
npm run check-slack
```

The test will:
1. Check if your Slack token is set
2. Verify the channel exists and is accessible
3. Send a test message to the channel
4. Send a reply in a thread
5. Delete the test messages after 5 seconds

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"SLACK_TOKEN environment variable is not set"**
   - In GitHub Actions: Check that the `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` secret is properly set in your repository settings
   - For local testing: Make sure you've set the token as described above

2. **"Error accessing channel"**
   - Check that the channel ID is correct
   - Ensure the bot has been added to the channel
   - Verify the bot has the necessary permissions

3. **"Error sending test message"**
   - Check the bot's permissions in Slack
   - Required scopes: `chat:write`, `chat:write.public`, `channels:read`

### Getting a Slack Bot Token

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Create a new app or select an existing one
3. Go to "OAuth & Permissions"
4. Add the required scopes: `chat:write`, `chat:write.public`, `channels:read`
5. Install the app to your workspace
6. Copy the "Bot User OAuth Token" that starts with `xoxb-`

### Finding a Channel ID

1. Open Slack in a web browser
2. Navigate to the channel
3. The channel ID is in the URL: `https://app.slack.com/client/TXXXXXXXX/CXXXXXXXXX`
   - The ID starting with `C` is your channel ID
