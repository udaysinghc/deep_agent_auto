Feature: Deep Agent Search and Task Execution
  As a logged-in user
    I want to access and view my dashboard and the Deep Agent search and overview
    So that I can explore available search prompts and understand the Deep Agent's capabilities

  Background:
    Given the user enters username "testuser1744775890841@internalreai.com" and password "Testuser@123"
    Then I should be logged in successfully
    When I click the deep Agent option

  @DeepAgentSearchPrompt
  Scenario Outline: Execute Deep Agent search prompt and validate results
    Given I click the check out from the welcome window
    When I search the prompt "<promat_user_search>" with follow-up query "<follow_up_query>"
    And I should see the status "Completed" for the task
    And the compute points should not exceed 150k
    And I should download the generated summary
    And I should fetch the search results
